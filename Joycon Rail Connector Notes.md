#### Mounting plan:

1. Desolder original rail connector from original cable.
2. Solder original rail connector to one side of Molex flat cable.
3. Solder new molex connector to original cable.
4. Run flat cable through case to reach joycon board location.
5. New molex flat cable will plug into new connector on original cable



#### To-Do

Need to determine if same-side or opposite-side cables are needed for each side by doing a test fit with paper.

A slot will need to be designed into the rail mounting surface of the case in order to accomodate the new ribbon cable.
